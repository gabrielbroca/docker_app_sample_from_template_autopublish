# Simple Deployment Config

Just two files you might need to know about:

## `host.config`
Set your app's hostname:
```
HOST=my-app.roca.tools
PORT=3000
```

## `docker-compose.yml`
Handles container setup automatically. You probably don't need to edit this.

## That's it!
Push to `production` branch and your app goes live! ðŸš€
